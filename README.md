 math stack exchange questionbank

i am tired of seeing questions on my math that i've never seen before. i am going to crash out. i cannot take it any more. there will be no surprises once i've seen every question. i make api calls that allow me to scroll through 100s of questions at once. there will be no more 'mr sherry special'. i am done with math.
